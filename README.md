SpreeBrands
===========

Spree Brands extension allows you to handle brands on Spree Admin

Installation
------------

Add spree_brands to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_brands'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_brands:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.
